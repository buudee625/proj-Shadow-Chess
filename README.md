## • Introduction
Shadow Chess is a combination of the western chess and [a popular game variation of the Chinese chess named "Banqi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqi), which means half chess, or "Anqi", which means dark chess. In this game variation, only half of the regular Chinese board is required and all of the 32 chess pieces are placed with faced down so the players do not know which piece is which, hence, "half" or "dark chess".

## • Game rules
In Shadow Chess, player Bloom (represented by blue pieces) will play against player Redd (represented by red pieces). At the start of the game, a total of 32 chess pieces, 16 for each player, are randomly distributed faced down across a 8 x 4 game board, and the game will randomly decide which player goes first. Each player takes one turn to flip a piece over, or move one of their pieces around. Every piece is limited to moving one grid directly next to itself, which means diagonal movements are prohibited. 

To launch an attack, both pieces must be uncovered and the attacking piece must be ranked higher than the enemy piece. When a piece is defeated, it is removed from the board and will no longer be playable. All game pieces follow this attacking rule with the exception of the Catapult piece.

When attacking with a Cataputl, there must be another piece, cover or uncovered, between the Catapult and the target enemy piece. As long as the condition is met, the Catapult's attack is not dictated by the rank hierarchy. This means the Catapult can defeat any pieces, including the enemy King and Catapults.

The game continues until either one side has no pieces left, or the game goes in a standstill scenario.

### Hierarchy and piece distribution
The ranking hierarchy is demonstrated below. The higher ranked piece can defeat pieces of the same rank, and all of the lower ranked pieces. However, Kings cannot defeat pawns as pawns are the only pieces capable of defeating a king. The Catapult is left out of the hierarchy since it has an unique capability.

### King > Queen > Bishop > Rook > Knight > Pawn

### Distribution:

* King: 1
* Queen: 2
* Bishop: 2
* Rook: 2
* Knight: 2
* Pawn: 5
* Catapult: 2
